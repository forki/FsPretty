# FsPretty

This is an FSharp implementation of the pretty printer library
described in "A Prettier Printer" by Philip Wadler (see:
http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.19.635 for the
publication).

The code here is based on a direct port of the wl-pprint library in
Haskell (see: http://hackage.haskell.org/package/wl-pprint).

Please see http://mjsottile.github.io/FsPretty/index.html for the main
web page for this project, including documentation and examples.
